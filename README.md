# Assignment Step Description

Read the given set of questions and solve them by writing queries using SQL Server
The estimated effort to complete this assignment is 2 - 3 hours
** Things to do **
* Clone the boilerplate
* Create sql queries based on the problem statement and expected solution
* Write all queries in the given queries.json file in Sequence and key names.
* Add that to the boilerplate that you have cloned and push it to gitlab 
  ( Note: You should have a new repo created in gitlab where it has to be pushed)
* Submit the assignment in Hobbes for evaluation and share score with your mentor.

## Problem Statement
Note management app (similar to Google Keep) is used to take notes, add notes into categories and set reminders for a note. Create the necessary DB schema (SQL Server) including tables, relationships and add sample data into each table.

### Expected Solution
* Create the tables for Note, Category, Reminder, User, NoteReminder and NoteCategory.
* User table fields: user_id, user_name, user_added_date, user_password, user_mobile
* Note table fields: note_id, note_title, note_content, note_status, note_creation_date
* Category table fields : category_id, category_name, category_descr, category_creation_date, category_creator
* Reminder table fields : reminder_id, reminder_name, reminder_descr, reminder_type, reminder_creation_date, reminder_creator

Insert the rows into the created tables (Note, Category, Reminder, User, NoteReminder and NoteCategory) as per attached snapshot(Data_Snapshot.docx).

Write the queries to carry out the below listed operations:

1.	Fetch the row from User table with Id=112233 and Password=’Maya1214’.
2.	Fetch all the rows from Note table with note_creation_date=’01/31/2019’.
3.	Fetch all the Categories created after ‘01/22/2019’.
4.	Fetch all category details which belongs to note with note id=1.
5.	Fetch all the Notes from the Note table with userId=112244.
6.	Fetch all the Notes from the Note table for category_id=1.
7.	Fetch all the reminder details for note id=2.
8.	Write a query to change the note_status to ‘Completed’ with note Id=3.
9.	Write a query to set a reminder of type ‘Personal Reminders’ for Note with note id=1. [Find reminder id based upon reminder_type]
10.	Write a query to detach all reminders from Note with note_id=2.

#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in your local machine
     
    `git clone https://gitlab-gl.stackroute.in/stack_dotnet_keep/keepnote-rdbms-assignment-boilerplate-.git`

2. Navigate to keepnote-rdbms-assignment-boilerplate folder

    `cd keepnote-rdbms-assignment-boilerplate`

3. Solve the assignment as per the requirements

4. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
5. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

6. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed

### Important instructions for Participants

> - The code must not be plagirized, the mentors will randomly pick the submissions and may ask you to explain the solution
> - The code must be properly indented, code structure maintained as per the boilerplate and properly commented
> - Follow through the problem statement shared with you
